We left the Lake District on\nMonday due to poor weather and drive into the Yorkshire Dales as it looked\nbrighter.<\/p>\n\n<p>It was still a wet day, but we did manage to see the Ribbleshead Viaduct, and\nthe three peaks. Finally, we stopped off at Settle for lunch and a quick walk up\nthe river. This wier is at an hydroelectric station and I would have tried a\ndifferent composition if I could have changed to the Tokina 11-16mm but it was\ntoo windy to change lenses outside.<\/p>\n\n<p>I could also have moved slightly to the left to capture the backgroun chimney\nwhilst not having the dark area on the far right but maybe next time\u2026<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Just before\nwe boarded, I got this quick shot of Cheryl, probably contemplating how many\ntimes I would point out different mountains during the trip. Well the answer was\nlots ;)<\/p>\n<\/div>",

As I drove up through Donisthorpe, i noticed this view of\nMoira Furnace.<\/p>\n\n<p>I quickly parked the car and walked up to the side of the canal. I took 6\nexposures and merged using Photomerge and cropped slightly.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Initially, we drove\nover to Castleton, planning to walk up Cave Dale and over to Mam Tor. However,\nthe strong winds suggested otherwise. Therefore, after a quick stroll, we\nreturned to the car and drove over to Fairholmes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Parked at the visitor\u2019s centre, we walked up Ladybower west bank up to Howden\nDam. The reservoir was absolutely full - lots of water pouring over the dams.\nJust before Howden dam, we found a few small waterfalls, this being the most\nphotogenic. After following a natural course down the hill, it is channelled\nthrough a small tunnel behind this wall into the dam.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was quite happy with the photo\u2019s taken today - the light varied from flat when\nthe sun disappeared behind the clouds, through to brilliant directional light. A\ngreat walk all in all.<\/p>\n<\/div>",
